Welcome to my site! I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Economics, University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/econ/about-us/). My research interests are mainly in econometrics.

Before coming to LA, I lived in Hong Kong for seven year, where I received Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mathematics and Economics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
